Il corso di THEATER FOR SOCIAL CHANGE (in inglese) del corso di Laurea in ECONOMIA E COOPERAZIONE INTERNAZIONALE PER LO SVILUPPO SOSTENIBILE del curriculum ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, COOPERATION AND MIGRATION, ha i seguenti obiettivi formativi: 
This course will investigate the critical issues and the collaborative creative  process that chart the field of theatre for social change.  The critical investigation is framed by the following questions: What happens  when theatre gets into the community? How do you define "community"? What  is the relationship between art and ideology? Can theatre stimulate political and  social change? What is the role of the artist in relationship to the diverse groups  of a community? How can art provide the tools for action to empower individuals  oppressed by because of their race, gender, class, religion and sexual  orientation? How can performance serve to raise our consciousness and  eliminate discrimination based on race, gender, class, and sexual orientation?  The collaborative creative process will be explored through practices drawn  upon Augusto Boalâ€™s work. These practices will consist of learning exercises  and developing performances taken from the Image Theatre and Forum  Theatre. This is a participatory and hands-on  course.
