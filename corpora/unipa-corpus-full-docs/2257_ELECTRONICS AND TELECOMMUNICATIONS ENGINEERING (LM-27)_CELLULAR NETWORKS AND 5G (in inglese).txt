Il corso di CELLULAR NETWORKS AND 5G (in inglese) del corso di Laurea magistrale in ELECTRONICS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ENGINEERING (FULLY ONLINE) del curriculum ELECTRONICS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ENGINEERING (LM-27), ha i seguenti obiettivi formativi: 
This course provides an overview of wireless networks, based on the presentation of the main technical features characterizing these networks (wireless propagation, interference, mobility), the main approaches and design principles, as well as some specific examples of wide-spread technologies for both cellular systems and wireless local area networks.  A first educational objective is understanding radio propagation and traffic  generation phenomena in order to identify the system requirements to be used  for network design.  A second educational objective, is understanding the main features and  technical aspects of public cellular systems, with special attention to LTE/5G and 802.11 networks.  Finally, a third educational objective is providing methods and approaches for evaluating complex radio systems, by characterizing the interactions between applications, physical layers, MAC layers, in order to be able to design/adapt existing protocols to the emerging network scenarios.
