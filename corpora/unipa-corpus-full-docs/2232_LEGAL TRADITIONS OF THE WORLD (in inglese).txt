Il corso di LEGAL TRADITIONS OF THE WORLD (in inglese) del corso di Laurea magistrale in COOPERAZIONE, SVILUPPO E MIGRAZIONI , ha i seguenti obiettivi formativi: 
The course aims to acquire knowledge of the notion of tradition in law and to  understand different legal traditions of the world; the foundation for a deep      understanding of legal tradition from an historical and comparative perspective.  In contrast to the positions which emphasize differences and  incommensurabilitiy between legal traditions, the course will bring the student to  formulate her/his own vision on how law had been, throughout history, the  product of a rich dialogue between local and global legal forms. Traditions will be identified, but not in definite form. This also explain the choice  of the Author of the text book (H. Patrick Glenn), chosen as primary reference,  to use the indefinite article "a" to name each legal tradition.  The student will learn that all legal systems are dialogic, dynamic and  interactive. So a theory of traditions is contemplated, but not constructed.  Learning about tradition is taken to be a process of learning from tradition.  Whether this is possible is taken to be a matter of practice.
