Il corso di HUMAN NATURE IN ECONOMICS AND POLITICS (in inglese) del corso di Laurea magistrale in SCIENZE DELLE AMMINISTRAZIONI E DELLE ORGANIZZAZIONI COMPLESSE del curriculum PUBLIC MANAGEMENT, ha i seguenti obiettivi formativi: 
This course offers an advanced survey of current debates about the ontology,  methodology, and aims of the social sciences. Core readings will address  questions such as: 1) Should explanation in the social sciences follow the model of explanation in  the natural sciences, or are there peculiarities about human beings and social  phenomena that demand a different approach? 2) Is there a difference between explaining and understanding human behavior? Which should be the goal of the social sciences? 3) What are social structures, practices, norms, institutions, etc.? What is the  relationship between individuals and larger social structures? Do social  structures exist over and above individuals? 4) Should explanation in the social sciences rely only on facts about individuals  and their mental states? Or are there some cases in which social phenomena  cannot be explained in terms of individual behavior? 5) Is social science value-laden in a different way or to a different degree than  natural science? Is it possible or desirable to have a value-free social science? Is objectivity in social science possible? We will consider specific topics for discussion and additional readings  depending on the interests of the seminar participants. Additional case studies  will also be provided.
