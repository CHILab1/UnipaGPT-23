Il corso di HUMAN RIGHTS: THEORY AND POLICIES del corso di Laurea magistrale in COOPERAZIONE, SVILUPPO E MIGRAZIONI , ha i seguenti obiettivi formativi: 
The course aims at providing students with an overall understanding of human rights rhetoric and structure. In particular the  course will dwell on: the structure of human rights (foundations, right holders, duty holders, protected interests, content); the  limits of rights; the interest and choice theory of rights; the moral/political justification of human rights; the philosophical and  legal evolution of human rights (at the international level); individual and collective rights. A deeper understanding of the  theoretical foundations of human rights will allow students to better handle the instrument/tool of human rights vis Ã  vis real  cases thanks to a better ability to frame (linguistically and theoretically) them and interpret the meaning and content of their  legal recognition. The objective of the course is to give students critical tools to know, understand and put in practice an approach useful to  cope with consequences deriving by the nexus working between human vulnerability reduction policies, building resilience  interventions, risk reduction strategies and the Neoliberal Governmentality, in sustainable development and migrations  governance real contexts.
