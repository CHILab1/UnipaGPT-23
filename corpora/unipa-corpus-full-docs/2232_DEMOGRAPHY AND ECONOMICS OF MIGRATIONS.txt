The aim of the course is to provide the student with the knowledge of economic theories, data sources and empirical  analyses, relevant to analyze migrations. The aim of the course is to provide basic methods and techniques needed to measure and understand demographic  phenomena. Students will learn fundamentals regarding the key components of demography: fertility, mortality and migration  and their societal implications; understand the mechanisms underlying the demographic transition theory; be able to identify  and manipulate key demographic components that range from the local to the global spatial scales and for different  population segments. The students will get an opportunity to learn how these demographic trends of growth and transition  affect migration. Attendants students (in group of 2-3) will complete a group work under the supervision of the instructor.  Through the help of the population theories illustrated during the course and the use of data from the main official sources  (Istat, Eurostat, United Nations, OECD), they develop the ability to analyze autonomously the main characteristics of migrants  in the country and describe it in a presentation to the classroom.
