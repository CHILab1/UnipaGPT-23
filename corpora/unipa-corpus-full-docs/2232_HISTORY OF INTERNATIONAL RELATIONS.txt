The History of International Relations course aims to train students in the  principles and fundamentals that still underpin relations between states and  national foreign policies today. Training, specifically, means to provide students  with a) the tools for the knowledge of the historical events that, from the Cold  War to the post-Soviet period, have determined the current international  framework; b) the tools for the knowledge of the state and supranational  structures that regulate international relations c) the tools for knowledge and  analysis of the action of non-governmental and non-state actors that are, today  more than ever before, protagonists of transnational and international life; d) a  more detailed analysis of the period from 1989 to the present day, within and  above all beyond the European dimension, especially given the possibilities of  working in international spheres such as development cooperation and working  in supranational organisations.
