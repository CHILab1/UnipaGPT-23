The so-called "Arab  springs" have been considered the beginning of a transition process for some  Arab countries and in recent years there has been a large production of books  and articles has investigated these events focusing mainly on events from 2011  onwards and / or by adopting a single, narrow perspective.

The course program will focus on the Near East and North Africa, with particular  reference to Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Lebanon, Palestine and Iraq, also with  specific references to the Gulf countries (eg Bahrain). The dynamics of social  contestation of student, youth and workers movements as well as of Islamist  movements and various forms of nationalist party of these realities will be  presented. The historical range identified will go from 1914 until 2011, and within  this period the events considered most impacting on regional and national  history will be selected. The aim of the course is to relocate the events of this  "under-studied history of contention" in the broader and already studied history  of North African and Middle Eastern countries.
