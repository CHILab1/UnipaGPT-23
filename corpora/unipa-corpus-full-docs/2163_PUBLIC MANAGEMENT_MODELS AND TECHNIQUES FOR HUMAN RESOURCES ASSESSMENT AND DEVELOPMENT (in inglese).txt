The course aims at providing students with knowledge and understanding in the  area of Work and Organizational Psychology. It is specified that can not be taught the use of any knowledge and intervention  tools and technics  reserved to the profession of psychologist to any students  who don't have the degree in psychology, as the exercise of such tools is  protected by the law establishing such professional. The course will be mainly focused on the analysis of: (a) the psychological  determinants of decision-making and choice adopted by decision makers to  identify effective strategies and policies for ensuring that the basic needs of  employees are met; (b) the psychology of change management programs to  improve group, organizational and community learning and performance in  organizations. Students will learn the basic principles that inform the analysis and  understanding of human behavior that is concerned with various aspects of  people in the workplace, including employee productivity and well-being. From a  methodological perspective, the course will show how the System Dynamics  (SD) approach can highlight the cognitive biases underlining the poor strategic  decisions made by managers, focusing on their strong prior incorrect beliefs  about the relationship among the key variables of the considered social system  (phenomenon). Besides, the role of SD in facilitating the change management  processes will be analyzed and discussed, putting on evidence the effectiveness  of such methodology in fostering individual and organizational learning.  Both real-world applications and research will be emphasized throughout the  course. A Community-Based Learning (CBL) approach will be adopted.
