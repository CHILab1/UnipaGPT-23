Vectorstore from emb and full corpus are not loaded since they exceed the maximum file capacity.

We provide the vectorstore generated from the unipa-corpus-clear.

Note that at development time was used an older version of langchain==0.0.19, we report the new version of vectorstore generated with the newer version langchain==0.3
